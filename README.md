# Reactify::Rails
Short description and motivation.

## Usage
How to use my plugin.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'reactify-rails'
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install reactify-rails
```

Then, run the install generator (commit your files to source control first!)
```bash
$ bundle exec rails g reactify:install
```

## Contributing
Contributions are very much welcomed, but please follow the procedure below:

1. File an issue on Github outlining what you are intending. Some new features may
not be a good fit for the gem and may be better off in their own gem (I'm trying to 
keep this one as lightweight as possible). Similarly, what appears to be bug may 
occasionally turn out to be deliberate in order to cover non-obvious edge cases. 
Better to check first before you spend valuable time writing code! Assuming the 
response to your issue is positive:
2. Fork the repo on Github
3. Create a new branch against master
4. Write tests (first!)
5. Write code until the tests pass
6. Push your code and file a pull request
